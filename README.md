# Class Components Intro c

## Learning Goals

- Translate function component syntax to class component syntax

## Introduction

So far throughout this phase, we've been writing all our components as
**function components**. Function components take in props, and return JSX.
React also gives us another way of writing components using **classes** instead
of functions.

For many years, the only way to use **state** and **lifecycle methods** in a
React component was via **class components**. Since the introduction of React
hooks in late 2018, that is no longer the case: function components can do
everything classes can do! (Well, almost).

You are still very likely to encounter the class components when reading about
React, and even are likely to see them on your first React job. So let's take a
look at the syntax and learn some of the ins and outs of writing class
components.

## Class Component Syntax

When we're writing a function component, the most basic version (without any
hooks) looks something like this:

```jsx
function BlogPost(props) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Here's what the same component looks like using the class syntax:

```jsx
import React from "react";

class BlogPost extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <article>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>{this.props.content}</p>
      </article>
    );
  }
}
```

Note that regardless of which syntax we use to define the component, we can use
both versions of the component the same way:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  // doesn't matter if BlogPost is a class component or a function component!
  <BlogPost title="Hello" content="World" />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Here are some notes about this class syntax:

- `class BlogPost`: the [**class declaration**][classes] gives us a template for
  creating JavaScript objects. In this case, the kind of object we're creating
  is a React component.

- `extends React.Component`: the `extends` keyword is JavaScript's way of
  providing inheritance to our class definitions. Our components **must**
  inherit from the `React.Component` class; this is where we'll get some
  additional behavior that we'll see later.

- `render()`: the `render` method is a special **lifecycle method** that must be
  defined on all of our class components. Just like with our function
  components, `render` is responsible for returning JSX!

- `this.props`: When React runs, any time we use `<BlogPost>` in a parent
  component, React will make a new **object** by calling constructor function
  `new BlogPost(props)` for us. All of the props passed down from the parent
  will be saved to that newly created object! So to access the props, we can use
  `this.props` inside of any method defined in our component. `props` alone
  won't work! We must use `this.props`.

```jsx
// when we write this:
ReactDOM.render(
  <BlogPost title="Hello" content="World" />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

// something like this happens in React's internal code
const component = new BlogPost({ title: "Hello", content: "World" });

// so inside the component, the props object is saved to the object:
class Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.props = props;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

You don't have to worry about what's happening under the hood in React, but for working with class components, here are the key takeaways so far:

- use `class MyComponent extends React.Component` to define your class component
- write a `render()` method that returns JSX
- any time you need access to props, use `this.props`
